# 1. Introduction
 Currently there is no easy way to create RAM users in bulk instead it can only be done by leveraging RAM API's. But we don't have any examples and working code to showcase that and this python tool helps in leveraging RAM API's for the common use cases so that others can reuse the code to perform RAM operations in bulk for the new or existing customers.
 
 # 2. Use Cases
 We have identified 3 common use cases.
 
  ## 2.1 Usecase: Creation of RAM users in bulk
  This is a common use case where in newly on boarded customers wants to create RAM users in bulk with proper permissions. 
  ## 2.2 Usecase. Deletion of RAM users in bulk
  This is another common use case where in admin would like to clean up dormant users as per the audit requirements etc.
  ## 2.3 Usecase. Pull RAM users list
  This is a certain use case where in customer has quarterly security audit requirement and as part that they need to pull the list of all RAM users to find out the dormant users who are not active for the last 3 months to fecilitate the clean up activities as per the audit requirements.

   #### 3.2.2 RAM Users Deletion csv Template
   Please use this template to pass in as input to python program for bulk user Deletion in RAM.
   ######Template name : 
    ram_user_deletion_list.csv
   ######Template Type : 
    Input File
   ######Template Description :

   #### 3.3.3 Pull RAM users csv Template
   This is the format of RAM users output file generated by the python program.
   ######Template name : 
    ram_user_list.csv
   ######Template Type : 
    Output File
